# Arduino-Based-Wireless-Notice-Board-using-Bluetooth-IOT-PROJECT-


This project involves the design and implementation of a wireless notice board system that uses an Arduino microcontroller and Bluetooth technology. The notice board can display messages sent from a smartphone or computer, making it ideal for use in schools, offices, and public places where information needs to be updated frequently and efficiently.

Features
Bluetooth Connectivity: Connect to the notice board wirelessly using Bluetooth to update messages remotely.
Arduino Controlled: Utilizes an Arduino board for controlling the display and processing incoming messages.
Real-time Updates: Instantly update and display messages from your smartphone or computer.
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use application for sending messages to the notice board.
Low Power Consumption: Designed to operate efficiently with minimal power usage.
